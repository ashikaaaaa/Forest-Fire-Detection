# Forest-Fire-Detection

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of forest areas into fire and no fire categories, helping in early wildfire detection through automated image analysis.

📂 Dataset
Taken from Kaggle: [The Wildfire Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elmadafri/the-wildfire-dataset)

Contains labeled images of forest regions with and without fire.

⚙️ Workflow
Preprocessing: Resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.

Model: CNN with convolutional, pooling, dropout, and dense layers.

Training: Binary classification using binary_crossentropy loss.

Evaluation: Accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, and recall.

📊 Results
Achieved strong accuracy on test data.

Training/validation curves show good generalization.

Curves included in the repo for reference.

🔮 Future Scope
Real-time input support via drones or cameras

Fire severity estimation & spread prediction

Web/mobile deployment
